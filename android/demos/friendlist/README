OpenSocial Android client library -- friendlist demo

friendlist is a simple sample application designed to introduce the OpenSocial
client library for Android. It includes a single Activity which first prompts
the user to choose one from a list of OpenSocial providers, then uses three-
legged OAuth to authenticate the user and fetch all friends from the selected
provider. The list of friends is rendered directly in the Android application
using the included View. The user can tap a name to see all information
available for that friend.

This is an Android application, and you will need to download the Android SDK
in order to build and run it:

1. If you haven't already, download the latest Android SDK from
   http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html and unzip it.
2. Open build.properties and update the sdk-location property to point to the
   location of your downloaded SDK.
3. OPTIONAL: If necessary, open default.properties and update the SDK target
   from the default level.
4. To run the application in the Android emulator, first launch the emulator
   (see http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/emulator.html if
   you're new to Android), then open a new command line window, navigate to
   the friendlist directory, and execute 'ant install' -- you should see
   "OpenSocial Friend List" in the set of applications. From here, you can
   invoke 'ant reinstall' to reinstall the application or 'ant uninstall' to
   remove it from the application set.
