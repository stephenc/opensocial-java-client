This application was built using the Google App Engine SDK and the Eclipse plugin. Further information on App Engine for Java and the Eclipse plugin can be found at:

http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html

To work with this code, you'll need to install the App Engine for Java SDK, and also install the Eclipse plugin for App Engine Java.

To work in Eclipse, you can create a new "Java project" and specify to create the project from "existing source" using the directory 'swt' as its root level.

Note: In order to successfully compile:
You'll need to copy the jar files located under war/WEB-INF/lib into an independent directory and make sure the project's Buildpath has these libraries included.
