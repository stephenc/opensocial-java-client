OpenSocial Java client library -- ThirdLeg demo

ThirdLeg is a simple sample web application demonstrating how to use the three-
legged OAuth process to ascertain the viewer's identity. It includes a standard
Java servlet filter which makes the necessary authentication calls and manages
the state of the application, as well as a simple JSP which executes a batch
request for the viewer's profile information and friends.

This application is packaged as a Google App Engine application. To run it,
follow these steps:

1. If you haven't already, download the latest Google App Engine SDK for Java
   from http://code.google.com/appengine/downloads.html and unzip it.
2. Modify the second line of the build.xml file, updating the sdk.dir property
   to point to the location of your downloaded SDK.
3. To run the application on the App Engine development server, open a new
   command line window, navigate to the ThirdLeg directory, and execute
   'ant runserver' -- now access your app at http://localhost:8080/.
4. To deploy the application to App Engine's production environment, register a
   new application ID at http://appengine.google.com, add this new ID between
   the <application></application> tags in war/WEB-INF/appengine-web.xml, and
   execute 'ant update' from the command line. Note that you may need to use
   the SDK's appcfg.cmd utility to input your account credentials before you
   can use this particular ant target -- see
